# Nbodies
This is a p5.js project that simulates a simple gravitational environment, puts n massive bodies in it and has them interact to produce some cool visuals.
Some examples of what it can do:

The project is a simpler version of [another](https://github.com/UdrK/Colliding_Galaxies) one of my projects and can be run in the same way. 

To allow for reproducibility of sketches, initial conditions can be saved in json files and then copy-pasted in the constants.js to obtain the same result.

The results can be saved as a .svg file by grabbing the svg tag in the html of the sketch.
